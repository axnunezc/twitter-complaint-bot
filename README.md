# twitter-complaint-bot
This Python script opens up Ookla Speed Test and fetches the results through web scraping. Then, it compares the results with the user's ISP's promised speeds. If the speeds are lower than promised, the script opens up Twitter, logs in using Selenium, and tweets a complaint to the ISP.
